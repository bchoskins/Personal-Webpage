    I am an avid believer in the power of data and enjoy working with data to solve problems that help others.
    
    I previously completed my Master of Science - MS in Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics: Data Science Specialization from the University of Notre Dame.
    
    I also participated in several machine and deep learning research projects during a two year undergraduate fellowship for the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Iowa. 
    
    I am currently working as a Data Scientist at Principal Financial Group.
